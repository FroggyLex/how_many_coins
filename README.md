# how_many_coins
Very basic script that outputs how many premium coins you'll have by the end of the Season 4 of Overwatch 2 given your current amount of coins and number of coins you've earned during the ongoing week, and assuming you gain 60 coins per week thanks to the weekly challenges. 

# How to use

- Download the `.py` file

- Install Python3 on your machine

- Open the folder where you placed the `.py` file, and open a command line terminal from there

- Run it as :

```python
python3 path/to/your/executable.py current_amount_of_coins_including_gained_this_week coins_already_earned_this_week
```

The result will appear in the terminal.
